### ⚡ Your Move, MSTR

Reply with:

1. ✅ Preferred tech stack or no-code platform
2. 🧠 Features you want built first (Booking system? Catalog? AI?)
3. 🧾 If you want me to generate full source code or live link via Netlify/Firebase

Then I’ll generate a **tailored scaffolded build**. No templates — we do it from scratch, like a real brand.
